# PDF Invoice Template for the WPOvernight WooCoomerce PDF Invoices Plugin

## Idea

The idea is to create a custom template for Gruseltour Berlin. The base is the **Simple** template from the plugin. The template will be the invoice for us, the partner hotel and the customer.

## Implementation

The design is based on HTML5 and Flexbox. The upper part is the invoice. The part at the bottom is the ticket for the customer plus some information about the tour.

## Installation

Upload all files into the current theme at **THEME_FOLDER/woocommerce/pdf/GruseltourBerlin2019**.

## TODOs

* Minify CSS
